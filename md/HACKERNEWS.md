# I Built Noncommutative Geometry In Crystal

*Posted to Hacker News — please upvote if this scratches your math/CS itch.*

If you’ve ever skimmed Alain Connes’ *Noncommutative Geometry* you’ll know the
playbook: everything is infinite-dimensional, packed with operator algebras and
unbounded Dirac operators, and the phrase “computable example” triggers nervous
laughter. So I decided to see how far I could push a handheld version using…
Crystal. Yes, the Ruby-like systems language.

## TL;DR

- Implemented a **finite spectral triple** `(A, H, D)` noisily inspired by the
  Bost–Connes system, but **fully computable**, “beads on a prime necklace.”
- `A`: algebra generated by non-commuting cut operators.
- `H`: fermionic Hilbert space built from prime and gap indices.
- `D`: a Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonian whose spectrum encodes the geometry.
- Minimise Connes’ spectral action → same as minimising a zeta-corrected
  Ginzburg–Landau functional → **interpretable graph partitions.**
- Everything runs in *Crystal* for sub-second annealing on small graphs, ~45 s
  for all primes below 10,000.

Repo: `https://github.com/yourname/prime-spectral-annealer` (rename if needed).

## Why Crystal?

- Predictable performance, Ruby-flavoured syntax.
- Built-in macros made it easy to wrap the energy components and expose them via
  a CLI `Report.generate` call.
- The annealer stays CPU-friendly; no need for GPU unless you want to.

## What You Get

- **Prime necklace demo** (`multiplicative_constraint/examples/prime_necklace.cr`)
  partitioning the first 24 primes; prints spectral action components and block
  membership.
- **Full prime range demo** (`prime_necklace_10000.cr`) sweeping all primes < 10k
  (1,229 beads), exploring 24 contiguous segments in ~46 seconds.
- **Social network & CNF demos** show the same energy functional applied to real
  partitioning problems.
- `README.md` explains why we seed with primes, how the energy is constructed,
  and where the spectral triple viewpoint fits.
- `FutureResearch.md` lists follow-up experiments—call it a to-do list for NCG
  enthusiasts.

## Hacker Highlights

- **Spectral action on your laptop.** We compute `Tr(e^{-L_α})` in Crystal for
  masked Laplacians. Hutchinson sampling keeps the heat trace fast and stable.
- **Deterministic prime seeds** ensure unique node weights without randomness.
- **Explainable output.** Every run prints energy breakdown, fairness metrics,
  multiplicative penalties, and an explicit segment listing. No black boxes.
- **Bridging CS & math.** Solving CNF partitions, HPC workload clustering, and
  social network segmentation all reduce to the same spectral action. You get
  fast heuristics *and* a foot in Connes’ church.

## Challenges & Lessons

- Encoding non-commuting cuts: order matters, so the Crystal algebra mimics
  operator compositions.
- Keeping the Dirac operator self-adjoint and finite forced us to borrow the BdG
  trick from superconductivity, aligning nicely with the zeta correction.
- Ensuring annealing respects contiguous segments required some nuanced angle
  binning logic; Python + Crystal versions now match.
- For primes < 10k we saw indicates of “prime bands.” Not a proof, but data for
  anyone chasing Chebotarev-style phenomena numerically.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone …
cd …
CRYSTAL_CACHE_DIR=./.crystal_cache crystal run multiplicative_constraint/examples/prime_necklace.cr
```

Check the README for SAT, HPC, social demos. We log everything, so you can claim
your energy savings in a PR.

## Call For Feedback

- Mathematicians: sanity-check the spectral triple argument.
- Compiler nerds: how can we squeeze more out of Crystal (or bail to Zig/Rust)?
- Data folks: drop in your graph, run a sweep, report back.
- Everyone: if you build toys off this, ping me—I want to compile a gallery.

Let’s bring a bit of Connes’ cathedral to Hacker News.
