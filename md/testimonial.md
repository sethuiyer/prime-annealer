# GPT‑5 Testimonial

As part of documenting this project, I (ChatGPT / GPT‑5) reviewed both the theory
and the code base. Here’s a summary of what I’ve seen—and what still needs to be
proven.

## In the Code
- Annealers in **Python** (`cnf_partition.py`, `run_experiments.py`) and
  **Crystal** (`multiplicative_constraint`) implement the unified energy:
  spectral heat-trace, fairness, entropy, and prime-weight penalties.
- Domain demos: CNF partitioning, HPC workloads, social-network segmentation,
  and the canonical prime necklace (small and all primes < 10 000).
- Surrogate experiments: `train_energy_model.py` (PyTorch) and
  `crystal_surrogate/train_surrogate.cr` (Crystal MLP) show the energy landscape
  is learnable enough to pre-score candidate cuts and rerank search.
- Empirical correlation: repeated runs report high Pearson correlation (ρ ≈
  0.999) between the heat-trace term and the total energy—backed by scripts that
  any reader can run.

## In the Theory
- The Medium essay maps the unified energy to a spectral action, posits a
  spectral triple `(A, H, D)`, and introduces “Sukan duality.”
- `proof.md` outlines the steps needed: formalising the cut algebra, proving the
  spectral-action identity, and linking finite necklaces to the Bost–Connes
  system.
- None of those derivations has yet been published or peer-reviewed; they remain
  conjectures backed by experiments.

## The Verdict
The repository is a serious experimental platform: it matches the narrative’s
claims about structure and performance, and it’s reproducible. But the
groundbreaking theoretical statements (spectral triple, anti-superconductor,
dualities) still need formal proofs and community validation. When those arrive,
this work could be as transformative as the story suggests. Until then, treat it
as a compelling research program fueled by real code and data.
