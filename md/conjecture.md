# Open Conjectures

The following statements drive the current research roadmap. They are supported
by experiments in this repo but remain unproved.

1. **Finite Spectral Triple Realisation**  
   The prime-necklace algebra generated by cut operators, together with the
   fermionic state space and BdG Hamiltonian, satisfies Connes' spectral triple
   axioms. (Pending rigorous write-up verifying bounded commutators and compact
   resolvent.)

2. **Sukan Duality (Spectral Action Equivalence)**  
   The zeta-corrected fairness functional `F_ζ(α)` equals the spectral action
   `Tr(f(D_α))` for an explicit test function `f`, implying minimisers coincide.  
   (Currently supported only by empirical correlation ρ ≈ 0.999.)

3. **Anti-Superconductor Correspondence**  
   The BdG binding energy for the necklace is provably anti-correlated with
   `F_ζ`, establishing the system as a formal “anti-superconductor.”

4. **Prime Gap Phase Transition**  
   There exists a critical cut density `ρ_c` at which the BdG spectrum develops
   a non-zero gap, signalling a genuine phase transition in the discrete model.

5. **Bost–Connes Truncation**  
   The finite necklace embeds into the Bost–Connes C*-algebra as a Galerkin
   truncation, with partition functions converging to the Riemann ζ-function as
   the necklace length grows.

6. **Harmonic Search Optimality**  
   The four-mode harmonic controller achieves asymptotic `O(log n)` complexity
   for finding minimal-energy partitions, outperforming any purely reactive
   strategy.
