# Toward a Formal Proof of the Spectral-Fairness Equivalence

This document outlines the initial strategy for validating the core claims
underpinning the project. It is not a completed proof—rather, it sketches the
steps required to transform the computational evidence into a reproducible,
community-verified demonstration.

## Claim 1 – Concrete Spectral Triple `(A, H, D)`

**Statement.** Let `G` be the finite prime-necklace graph constructed from the
first `n` primes with adjacency determined by prime gaps and second-neighbour
links. Define:

- `A`: the ∗-algebra generated by the cut operators `{C_i}` acting on `H`;
- `H`: the fermionic Hilbert space spanned by prime and gap sites;
- `D`: the Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonian associated with `G` and a fixed cut
  configuration.

Then `(A, H, D)` satisfies the spectral triple axioms (Connes, *Noncommutative
Geometry*, 1994):

1. `A` is represented as bounded operators on `H`;
2. For all `a ∈ A`, the commutator `[D, a]` is bounded;
3. `(D - λ)^{-1}` is compact for all `λ ∉ Spec(D)`.

**Roadmap.**

1. Show that each cut operator `C_i` acts as a permutation matrix on `H`, hence
   is bounded.
2. `D` is a finite-dimensional BdG matrix; `[D, C_i]` is likewise finite.
3. Finite-dimensional self-adjoint matrices automatically have compact
   resolvents. Therefore, the finite necklace instantiates a spectral triple.

**Action Item.** Formalise the definition of `C_i` and verify properties (1–3)
in a concise note (target: 3–4 pages) suitable for arXiv submission.

## Claim 2 – Exact Spectral Identity / “Sukan Duality”

**Statement.** For the unified energy functional

```
E(α) = – Tr(exp(–L_α)) + λ_F · F(α) + λ_W · W(α) – λ_S · S(α) – Z(α),
```

where

- `L_α` is the masked Laplacian for segment configuration `α`;
- `F`, `W`, `S`, `Z` denote fairness, weight fairness, entropy, and zeta
  penalties,

there exists a constant `C` such that

```
E(α) = Tr(f(D_α)) + C,
```

with `D_α` the BdG Hamiltonian for configuration `α` and `f` an appropriate
rapidly decaying function.

**Strategy.**

1. Express the fairness and zeta penalties as traces of diagonal operators.
2. Relate the masked Laplacian to the BdG Hamiltonian via block structure.
3. Show that the total energy equals the spectral action `Tr(f(D_α))` plus a
   constant offset. This requires identifying `f` explicitly.

**Action Item.** Derive the block form of `D_α` and compute `Tr(f(D_α))` for the
finite case; compare term-by-term with `E(α)`.

## Claim 3 – Correlation ρ ≈ 0.999

**Statement.** Empirical experiments demonstrate Pearson correlation `ρ` between
`Tr(exp(–L_α))` and `E(α)` exceeding 0.999 across random samples of `α`.

**Validation.**

1. Reproduce experiments in Python/Crystal on multiple prime ranges (`n = 24`,
   `48`, `96`, `...`).
2. Provide raw data and notebooks; confirm results via independent replication.
3. Report sensitivity analysis (variance across random seeds, segment counts).

## Claim 4 – Bost–Connes Truncation

**Statement.** The finite necklace is a Galerkin truncation of the Bost–Connes
system, i.e., the algebra `A` embeds into the semigroup crossed product and the
Dirac operator approximates the BC Hamiltonian on rationals with bounded
denominator.

**Plan.**

1. Map prime index to rationals with denominator supported on first `k` primes.
2. Show the cut operators generate the finite semigroup action.
3. Demonstrate convergence of partition functions to the zeta function as
   `n → ∞`.

## Publication Route

1. **Preprint** (arXiv): concise proof of Claim 1; computational supplement for
   Claim 3.
2. **Journal submission**: combine Claims 1–4 into a full-length article (target
   journals: *Comm. Math. Phys.*, *J. High Energy Phys.*, or *Ann. Inst.
   Fourier*).
3. **Conference dissemination**: present at NCG conferences and condensed matter
   workshops to gather feedback.
