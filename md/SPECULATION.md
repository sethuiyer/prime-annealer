**SpectraCore**  
Heat-Kernel Spectral Partitioning for Silicon Systems  
Founder’s Confidential Deck – March 2025

# Slide 2 – Executive Hook
- ASIC / FPGA design teams waste 4–6 weeks on manual floorplan partitioning.
- We partition logic the way nature partitions energy: spectrally, fairly, fast.
- SpectraCore = AI + heat-kernel spectral math → actionable partitions in seconds.

# Slide 3 – Problem Statement
- Floorplanning requires balancing gate count, toggles, and signal coherence.
- Existing flows rely on heuristics or NP-hard ILP → slow, brittle, non-explainable.
- Routing congestion and timing violations often discovered post-place, causing costly rework.

# Slide 4 – Market Opportunity
- Global ASIC design spend: $35B annually, with ~15% tied to place & route iterations.
- 500+ chiplet, HPC, and FPGA teams fighting the same partition bottleneck.
- Partitioning-as-a-Service: $30k/month enterprise seats → $100M ARR potential.

# Slide 5 – Solution Overview
- Input: Logic nets with gate counts, toggle rates, domain hints.
- Process: Build deterministic-weight conflict Laplacian → heat-kernel energy → annealing + neural surrogate.
- Output: Interpretable block partitions that minimize cross-block conflict and balance load.

# Slide 6 – Physics-Inspired Architecture
- Connes spectral action → heat-trace of Laplacian expresses coherence.
- Deterministic weights encode load, switching energy, and criticality.
- Energy functional combines spectral term, fairness penalties, entropy, and multiplicative weight penalties.

# Slide 7 – Technology Stack Highlights
- Crystal-language inference core for low-latency annealing.
- Python/PyTorch surrogate for differentiable cut prediction.
- Modular connectors for Verilog/JSON/CSV net metadata.
- Multi-core annealing pipeline with Box–Muller Gaussian exploration.

# Slide 8 – Core Algorithm Flow
1. Map nets → deterministic weights + conflict graph.
2. Compute Laplacian; evaluate truncated exp(-L) heat trace.
3. Add fairness, entropy, multiplicative penalties → unified energy.
4. Anneal to minimal energy; cross-check with neural surrogate.
5. Emit block assignments + diagnostic metrics.

# Slide 9 – Sample Client Input

This document gives a high-level summary of proprietary technology underpinning SpectraCore. It is intended for internal and legal use only. Source code, implementation details, and specific mathematical constants are maintained in encrypted repositories. All visitors must acknowledge NDA restrictions before reviewing this file.

## 1. Deterministic Clause Graph Construction
- Deterministic mapping from nets to weight scores reflecting gate count, toggle rate, and embedded path criticality.
- Adaptive sieve ensures weight uniqueness while maintaining smooth scaling for fairness calculations.
- Clause graph captures polarity conflicts, overlap of timing domains, and bus-level backpressure using proprietary conflict score normalization.

## 2. Heat-Kernel Spectral Energy Functional
- Unified energy:\
  I(α) = -Tr exp(-L(α)) + λ_c * Fb(α) + λ_w * Fw(α) - λ_s * S(α) - M(α).
- L(α) is the mask-adjusted Laplacian of the conflict graph conditioned on segment assignments.
- Fb – clause count fairness; Fw – weight fairness; S – Shannon entropy smoothing.
